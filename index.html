  <h1>An analysis on the Dark Knight:</h1>
  <h2>Who is Batman? : </h2>
  <p>Throughout history Batman has been regarded as one of the greatest superheroes of all time by many since his creation all the way back in 1939 by Bill Finger and Bob Kane who had a more obscure idea of the character before we got the adapation that we all know and love today. The evolution of Bruce Wayne and his identity as the caped crusader through the years serves to showcase the journey of a man who has underwent so many experiences that it leads one to wonder if he could even be considered a mere mortal anymore.</p>

  <h2> The Hero that Gotham Needs : </h2>
  <p> Across all of the caped crusaders various adaptations one thing stands above the rest. How no matter what he is always able to overcome the immense odds that are put up against his favor in order to overcome whatever problem comes his way. One of the main ways that he showcases this is by dealing with his rogues gallery which serves as one of the toughest that hero could have. Consisting of villians like the Joker, Two-Face, Bane, Ra's Al Ghul, the Riddler, and Mr. Freeze his villians all serve as a perfect challenge to Batman in many ways. With Two-Face presenting the duality of choice and fate, the Riddler challenging Batman's intellect as a Detective, Bane representing the physical challenges that Batman always has to face, and the Joker serving as the representation of anarchy and chaos, the exact counterparts to justice and order. These are not even all of Batman's villians which serves as an example of how well written this character is to the point that there are many foils that challenge his views. </p>
  <h3> The Perfect Foil to Batman :
  <p> However, it is very important to highlight that throughout all of Batman's villians the most prevalent one of them all is the clown prince of Gotham himself, the one and only, Joker. The Joker serves as the perfect foil to Batman because it is almost like for one to exist, the other one has to. One can think about it through the concept Yin and Yang, without the other both cease to exist. The chaos and anarchy threatened by the Joker directly impose the justice and order that the dark knight is trying enforce across Gotham , yet deep down Batman and the Joker are so alike. Two men whose lives were altered after their entire world shattered in just one day, only that they both decided to pursue different paths after such tragic events. After all as the Joker himself states at the end of "The Dark Knight", "[madness], as you know, is a lot like gravity. All it takes is a little push"(Nolan). In the Joker's perspective all it takes is just one bad day. </p>

    <h2> Conclusion :
    <p> In general nowadays Batman's influence across pop culture can be noted through hisvarious adaptations in many forms of media such as movies, animated television shows, and of course the original source, the comic books. As the years have gone by more villians and members of Batman's have been introduced in on order to build upon hiys mythos even further. As a fanatic of Batman myself I can only hope that they keep developing him even further as a character as that is what makes him seem beyond that of a mortal. A normal human being without supowers in a world filled with them who faces impossible odds at all times and still overcomes them. The symbol of justice, vengeance, darkness, and of the night, he is Batman. </p/>
